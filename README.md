# Battery_ECM_Parameter_Estimation
 A software tool to online identification of lithium-ion battery equivalent circuit model parameters


Battery equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are widely used to describe the behavior of batteries in various applications, such as electric vehicles. However, accurate parameter estimation of ECMs remains a challenging problem due to the complex electrochemical processes involved in battery operation and the limited availability of measurement data. This article presents a software tool for estimating the equivalent circuit model of a lithium-ion battery based solely on available data of battery voltage and current. The proposed method utilizes experimental data to extract charge and discharge profiles and calculate the state of charge (SOC) throughout the cycle. The tool then uses curve fitting and Kirchhoff equations to estimate the static and dynamic parameters of the equivalent circuit of the battery. An illustrative example is presented using the data of a Panasonic 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion battery. The performance of the estimation tool is evaluated by comparing the extracted model data with experimental battery data, and the battery equivalent model is prepared for future use. The proposed method provides an easy and relatively accurate way to obtain battery parameters and form its equivalent circuit for future works.
